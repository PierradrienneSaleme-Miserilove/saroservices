## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/saro_chic_et_conseil.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd saro_chic_et_conseil
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

## üíª Development

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so changes you make to the code will be reflected live in the browser.

## üì¶ Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

```sh
bun run build
```

This command bundles the application and outputs the static files to the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on the Cloudflare network.

To deploy the application directly to your Cloudflare account, ensure you have the Wrangler CLI configured, then run:

```sh
bun run deploy
```

This will trigger the build process and deploy the application using the configuration in `wrangler.toml`.

Alternatively, you can connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages for continuous deployment.
